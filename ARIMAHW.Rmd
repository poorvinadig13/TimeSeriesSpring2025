#The ARIMA(5,0,1) model means it used 5 past values and 1 past error to make predictions. The model found an average value around 108 and gave a good fit overall. Some accuracy numbers like RMSE and MAE look reasonable, but MAPE is infinite, which might be because there are zero values in the data.
